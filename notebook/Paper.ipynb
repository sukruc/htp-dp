The first dataset is obtained from a boiling experiment with a single tube in a vertical orientation. The second dataset is obtained from a boiling experiment with a bundle of 19 tubes in a horizontal orientation. The details of the input and output variables are given in Tables 1-3.\n",

    "## Scoring definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### $R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$R^2$ is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. In this study, we use the following definition of $R^2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_i$ is the true value of the $i$th sample, $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value of the $i$th sample, and $\\bar{y}$ is the mean value of the true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that $R^2$ can be biased upwards for models with more parameters, even if they are meaningless. This is called the [overfitting] phenomenon. To avoid this, we use the adjusted $R^2$ score, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - p - 1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of samples and $p$ is the number of model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAE\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of difference between two continuous variables. For two vectors $y$ and $\\hat{y}$, MAE is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Root mean squared error (RMSE) is a quadratic scoring rule that also measures the average magnitude of the error. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$RMSE$ can be driven up by outliers and does not indicate under- or over-estimation. To address this issue, we use the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and weighted absolute percentage error (WAPE) scores whose details are given below that penalize errors relative to the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAPE\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a measure of prediction accuracy of a forecasting method in statistics. For two vectors $y$ and $\\hat{y}$, MAPE is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ MAPE = \\frac{100}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left| \\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_i}{y_i} \\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### WAPE\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted absolute percentage error (WAPE) is a measure of prediction accuracy of a forecasting method in statistics. For two vectors $y$ and $\\hat{y}$, WAPE is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ WAPE = \\frac{100}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left| y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Bias %\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted percentage bias is a measure of systematic error in regression models. For two vectors $y$ and $\\hat{y}$, weighted percentage bias is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Weighted Bias \\% = \\frac{100}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( -y_i + \\hat{y}_i \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking bias of the model is essential especially when modeling physical phenomena and built models are possibly used for extrapolation. In such cases, a model with a non-zero bias is not reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hocanin score\n",
    "\n",
    "Hocanin score is a measure of prediction accuracy of a forecasting method in statistics. For two vectors $y$ and $\\hat{y}$, Hocanin score is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Hocanin = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_i}{y_i} \\right)^2 $$\n",

    "# Models\n",

    "* `tolerance`: The tolerance for the optimization algorithm\n",
